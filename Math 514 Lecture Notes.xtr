\begin{XTRtheorem}[Forward Euler (one-step) is consistent]
We take the equation for LTE
\begin{equation}
\tau_n = \frac{u_{n+1} - u_n}{\Delta t} - f(u_n)
\end{equation}
and substitute in the Taylor expansion of $u_{n+1} = u(t_{n+1})$ around $u_n = u(t_n)$. This Taylor expansion is
\begin{equation}
u_{n+1} = u_n +
\end{equation}
