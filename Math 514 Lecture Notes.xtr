\begin{XTRtheorem}[First mean value theorem for definite integrals]
If $f:[a,b] \to \R$ is continuous and $g$ is an integrable function that does not change sign on $[a,b]$, then there exists $c \in [a,b]$ such that
\begin{equation}
\int_a^b f(x)g(x) dx = f(c)\int_a^b g(x)dx
\end{equation}
\end{XTRtheorem}
